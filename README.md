# frontend_project_crocheting101

Anytime-course: Software Development Skills: Front-End 2022-23  

The course begins with tasklist where I learned responsiviness, Sass, flexbox, navigation button and much more. You can find the tasklist result from gitHub: https://github.com/Viiuska/Frontend_part_1 and view it from https://viiuska.github.io/Frontend_part_1


In this course, the course project had to meet 4 criteria  
1. Page with navigation  
2. Responsive styles with CSS  
3. Flexbox and CSS Grid  
4. Deployed Website

I made Crochetin 101 website because I have been lately into crocheting. Being beginner I used a lot of Lorem ipsum to fill the text areas. I took the base structure from the course material and then added my own visio to the project.

I kept a learning diary throughout the course. You can follow my front-end course in more detail:https://lut-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/viia_mantymaki_student_lut_fi/EaPyHrl8eXBIpcXdfem8-N8BOT-Lv7K4M8tmi9_B_CHtMQ?e=GQPzeI
